            <h2>Compound Interest</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is often referred to as "interest on interest." It allows your investment to grow exponentially over time, as the interest you earn also earns interest. This principle highlights the importance of starting to save early.</p>
            <p>For example, if you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, after 10 years, you would have approximately $1,628 due to compounding effects. This powerful concept emphasizes the value of time in investing.</p>

            <h2>Long-term Investments</h2>
            <p>Long-term investments involve holding assets for an extended period, typically five years or more, to achieve substantial gains. A well-diversified investment portfolio can mitigate risks and maximize returns.</p>
            <p>Common long-term investment strategies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stock Market:</strong> Investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can yield significant returns over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Government and corporate bonds can provide a steady income stream and are typically less volatile than stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Investing in properties can generate rental income and appreciate in value.</li>
            </ul>
