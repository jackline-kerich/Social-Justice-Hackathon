            <h2>Understanding Taxes</h2>
            <p>Taxes are compulsory contributions levied by governments on income, property, sales, and other transactions. Understanding the different types of taxes is essential for effective financial planning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Income Tax:</strong> A tax on the earnings of individuals and businesses. It's usually progressive, meaning the rate increases as income increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Property Tax:</strong> Tax based on the value of owned property, often used to fund local services like schools and infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales Tax:</strong> A consumption tax imposed on the sale of goods and services, typically collected at the point of sale.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tax Deductions and Credits</h2>
            <p>Tax deductions and credits can significantly reduce your tax burden. Knowing how to leverage them is key to effective tax planning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax Deductions:</strong> These reduce your taxable income, leading to a lower overall tax bill. Common deductions include mortgage interest, state taxes, and charitable contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> These directly reduce the amount of tax owed, making them more valuable than deductions. Examples include the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.</li>
            </ul>
